In this lab, I primarily worked with Node.js and the node-fetch package to retrieve data from the JSONPlaceholder API using Fastify. 

I started by creating a lab file and initializing a Node.js folder. I then installed the node-fetch package, which allowed me to make HTTP requests from my Node.js application. I added the Fastify starter code. 

I used node-fetch to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API. This involved making HTTP requests to the API, retrieving JSON data, and handling it within your application.

In this lab I gained practical experience working with Node.js, integrating external packages, setting up a Fastify server, and retrieving data from an API using node-fetch !
